Is it an important effect in capillary zone electrophoresis? Explain the reasons for your answers."

Estimate the rate required for molecular diffusion to be fast enough to avoid temperature gradients. Does it need to occur many times while the molecule is in the column or once? Determine a reasonable way to quantitatively estimate the diameter required and then calculate the diameter required to meet this condition. Compare your estimate with the value used in the paper."

    "[Ocean Optics](http://oceanoptics.com/) is a company that became very succesful by introducing a simple monochromator coupled to a CCD array detector. An array detector is at the heart of video cameras and typically contains 1024x1024 pixels on a 1\"x1\" square array. Their typical monochromator disperses the entire visible spectrum (400-800 nm) across the entire array and displays the intensity of each pixel on a computer screen. You can then see the changes in the light intensity at every wavelength as an experiment is conducted so it is a very versitile instrument. Assume the grating has 600 lines/mm and is 1\" square. It is blazed for 500 nm.\n",

    "Ocean Optics has just contact you to act as a consultant for their new line of spectrometers that has both good resolution and wide spectral coverage. They intend to create it using the same CCD array detector and two gratings. One grating disperses the light vertically and the other disperses it horizontally. This strategy is called cross-dispersion. The latter grating has 300 lines/mm and is 1\" square but it is blazed for 6 microns (6000 nm). That means the visible light would be diffracted into high orders, e.g. 500 nm light would diffracted preferentially into 12th order since 500x12=6000. That has the unforunate consiquence that the 11th order of 545 nm and the 13th order of 462 nm would also appear at the same angle. The key to Ocean Optic's instrument is that the first grating would seperate the 11th, 12, 13th, etc. orders vertically. Thus the vertical dimension provides broad spectral coverage while the horizontal direction provides high resolution.\n",

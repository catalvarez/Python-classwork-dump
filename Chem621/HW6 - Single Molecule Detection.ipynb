    "Single molecule spectroscopy has become a dominant technique because it allows one to by-pass the averaging effects when we are watching what millions of molecules are doing. The following questions are based on the article [\"Real-Time Detection of Single Molecules in Solution by Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy\"](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac00113a019) by Nie, Chiu, and Zare, Anal. Chem volume 67 pp 2849 (1995). This paper is one of the foundational papers for the field of single molecule spectroscopy. The paper uses Rhodamine 6G as the probe molecule. The spectroscopic properties of R6G are shown below (from F.P. Schafer - \"Topics in Applied Physics - Dye Lasers\", page 89, Springer-Verlag, 1977).\n",

The total rate is the sum of all the rates depopulating an energy level. The lifetime of a level is the reciprocal of the total rate. The quantum efficiency for a level emitting light is the ratio of the radiative rate to the total rate. The absorption cross-section is given on the graph. You should also remember the relationship $\\ln(\\frac{I_0}{I}) = \\sigma N l$ where $I_0$ and $I$ are the light intensity before and after the sample, $\\sigma$ is the absorption cross section in square cm, $N$ is the concentration in molecules per cubic cm, and $l$ is the pathlength in cm.

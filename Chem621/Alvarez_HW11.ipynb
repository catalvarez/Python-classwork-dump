    "Eddy migration is the multiple paths that particles can take through the column that cause the flow velocity to vary; this causes broadening since some molecules will then have a slightly faster retention time and some will have a slightly slower one. The broadening would be directly impacted by the voltage, because the voltage will cause a temperature gradient across the tube, thus affecting the flow rate. It would be dependent on the column diameter, because minimizing the diameter would minimize the temperature gradient as well as allowing the particles to be closer to the average temperature as they would travel across the tube more frequently. This is an important effect for CZE, because of it's effects on the peak broadening."

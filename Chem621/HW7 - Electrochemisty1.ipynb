    "A solution is prepared by mixing 50 mL of 0.01 M lithium napthalate (the reduced anion of napthalene), 5 mL of 0.02 M cupric nitrate, and 5 mL of 0.04 M buckminsterfullerene (C<sub>60</sub>). A platinum electrode is placed in the resulting solution. A second solution is prepared by inserting a silver electrode into a solution containing 0.10M sodium chloride. An AgCl coating is formed on the electrode by applying an external potential that oxidizes some of the Ag metal to create an AgCl precipitate at the surface. The coated Ag electrode is now ready to be used as one of the two half-cells for our measurements. A salt bridge is connected between two solutions and the potential is measured between the two electrodes with a high input impedance potentiometer.\n",
